- [x] [Project 6: Interactive Video Player](https://github.com/kristyburge/techdegree-interactive-video-player) -
*Final Grade:* **Exceeds Expectations** :100::sparkles:

Built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. This project also uses MediaElementJS and SASS.

**How it works:**
The video player synchronizes the video with the transcript in two ways:

1. The transcript's current position is highlighted as the video progresses.

2. When users click any part of the transcript, they will be taken to the appropriate place in the video.

- [x] [Project 7: Guessing Game Show App](https://github.com/kristyburge/techdegree-game-show-app) - *Final Grade:* **Exceeds Expectations** :100::sparkles:

Created a Game Show App with vanilla JavaScript using arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, and events.

**GAME RULES:**
* Guess the phrase by selecting a letter on the screen's keyboard
* You get 5 chances.
* Guess the phrase before you run out of turns!
* Guess 5 wrong letters and you lose the game.

- [x] [Project 8: SVG Animations](https://github.com/kristyburge/techdegree-svg-animations) -

This project uses optimized SVGs and CSS3 Animations & Transforms to create a fun site devoted to Corgi Kennels.

- [x] [Project 9: Web App Dashboard](https://github.com/kristyburge/techdegree-web-app-dashboard) -
*Final Grade:* **Exceeds Expectations** :100::sparkles:

Built the front end of an interactive dashboard for a web application from scratch using advanced web techniques including SVG graphics and JavaScript programming. Implemented JavaScript-driven charts and graphics using the [Chart.js library](https://www.chartjs.org/). Users can save settings to local storage.

Built the front end of an employee directory from scratch and update the dynamic data through a public API. The employee directory features 12 employees (which update each time the app is displayed) and when an employee's card is clicked on, a modal window appears displaying more information about that employee. This project uses JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON objects through the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me).

Built an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. I bootstrapped the project using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I built out the components from a mockup, integrated CSS, and set up routing. This project was not just about learning React, but also about learning how to handle URL routing, modular code design, setting and using state and stateless components, and fetching JSON data via an API.
